Problem: We have some images of back side of smart NID card.
	 We need to convert images to base 64 string.
	 Postman get request with the base 64 strings to fetch NID datas.

Pseudocode:

	For Single Image:
		
		1)Select an image file.
		2)Read the image path.
                3)Take a variable and assign with encoder.
                3)Encode the image data in base64 string.
                4)Print the string.
		5)Save the string for further use.
	
	 For Multiple Image:
		#Iterate over the files inside the folder.
		1)Take an empty list for base 64 string.
		2)Read the path of the folder which contains images.
		3)Iterate, over the images with the for loop.
                3)Take a variable and assign with encoder.
                4)Encode the images into base 64 strings.
                5)Extend the base 64 string data to the empty list.
                6)Print the string data from the list.
		7)Save the string for further use.

After getting the base 64 stings,
Postman request with the strings and fetch NID datas.
